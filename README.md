## Datasets

Our dataset is generated based on [CAMO](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h-OqZdwkuPhBvGcVAwmh0f1NGqlH_4B6), with the primary distinction being the creation of corresponding background images. We will release the image dataset, and the EEG data will be made available upon request. Please contact the first author via the email provided in the paper for access.
